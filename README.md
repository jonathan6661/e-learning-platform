# e-learning-platform

Learning is an ongoing process that allows you to learn about or learn about a given subject. Current search engines give results that include all types of media. The objective of the project is to allow the learner to configure the type of training he wants to have (level of expertise, duration allocated, type of specialization, background, age, use, duration of video sequences, duration of sessions , ...) so that the platform selects a series of supports of all types from different channels (youtube, twitter, web search, ...) by organizing them by level. At the end of each level, a series of exercises or a quiz is used to assess the learner's level of learning to take him to the next level.
In phase 1, the training materials will be sorted by the coach through an ergonomic interface (for example a table in which the access link to the support appears with possibly information on the reputation of the support or the author of the support allowing to have an idea on the relevance for the body of the formation or for the complementary supports). Ability to view the support of the class by level, to classify it within the same level, to delete it and to archive it.
